# Parallel and Concurrent Programming

Parallel and concurrent programming unlock the full potential of modern hardware, enabling applications to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. While these concepts might seem intimidating at first, understanding their fundamentals is crucial for building efficient, responsive software that can handle today's computational demands.

## Core Concepts

Understanding parallel and concurrent programming begins with grasping the distinction between these approaches and sequential programming. **Sequential programming** executes instructions one after another in a single thread, while **concurrent programming** manages multiple tasks that may overlap in time, and **parallel programming** executes multiple tasks simultaneously across multiple cores or processors.

The key difference: concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once, while parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.
