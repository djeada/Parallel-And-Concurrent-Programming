# Parallel and Concurrent Programming

Concurrent and parallel programming are powerful techniques that can enhance the performance and responsiveness of your applications. This guide demystifies these concepts, covering the differences between sequential and non-sequential programming, as well as the fundamentals of processes and threads. You'll find practical examples in popular languages like C++, Python, and JavaScript, enabling you to apply your new knowledge effectively to your projects.
