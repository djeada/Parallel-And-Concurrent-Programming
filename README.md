Concurrent and parallel programming can seem intimidating, but this guide makes it easy to understand. From sequential vs non-sequential, to processes and threads, we'll cover the key concepts you need to know. You'll also find examples in popular languages like C++, Python and JavaScript, making it easy to apply what you learn to your own projects.
